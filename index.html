        Assisting Audit Tem in making Financial Audit at Socially Owned Enterprises
        privatized with Special Spin-Off by Kosovo Privatization Agency. Key
        objectives were investigating companies if they fulfilled all commitments taken
        by contracts between them and KPA regarding a number of employees hired
        and maintained for a minimum time limit, as well as required financial capital
        investments in order that the Agency could freely transfer the ownership
        to new owners who firstly bought a specific company through auction.
        Observation of every invoice in terms of investment, investigation of all records
        of every employee hired, and if the salary, pension contribution, and taxes
        were paid, was my target in this project. In total, our Audit Team has made
        more than 20 successful Financial Audits in such giant companies that were
        privatized by KPA. Despite this Government project, I was a team member in
        different audit projects at private-owned enterprises.
